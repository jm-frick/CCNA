Layer 3 is responsible for routing packets to their destination and for QoS. 
IP is the best known layer 3 protocol, it is connectionless with no acknowledgments at layer 3. Other protocols include ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) and IPSec (IP Security).
IP addressing is a logical addressing scheme which is implemented at layer 3. The network designer uses IP addressing to partition the network into smaller subnets. Improves performance and security and makes troubleshooting easier. 
3 main IP traffic types: Unicast - to a single destination host, Broadcast - to all hosts on the subnet, Multicast - to multiple interested hosts. 

Decimal to binary:	256	128	64 32	16 8 4 2 1

IPv4 Addresses are 32 octets long, written in 4 octets in dotted decimal format. Each octet is 8 bits long and a value ranging from 0 to 255, broken into 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1. 
To set the boundary between logical networks (subnets), the IP address is combined with a Subnet Mask.

Subnet Mask:
A host can send traffic directly to another host on the same subnet via switches.
For a host to send traffic to another host in a different subnet, it must be forwarded by a router. 
The host needs to understand if the destination is on the same or a different subnet in order to know how to send it. The subnet mask is used for this.
Subnet mask is 32 bits long, and can be written in dotted decimal or slash (CIDR) notation. 
Always begins with contiguous 1's, 1's and 0's are not mixed (10101) in a subnet mask. Can be 11110000, but not 10100110.

Network and Host portion:
A host's IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion.
The subnet mask defines where the boundary is.
Example IP: 192.168.10.15, 255.255.255.0 - host portion after .10
If the host wants to communicate with another IP address that begins with 192.168.10.x, it knows it is on the same subnet and can send traffic directly.
If the host wants to communicate with another host with any other network address (example: 192.168.11.20), it knows to send the traffic via a router.
The host portion of the address specifies the individual host and must be unique on that subnet.
Hosts do not have to be numbered sequentially. 
For a network portion 10.10.10.x, hosts can be 10.10.10.10 and 10.10.10.20.
Two hosts cannot have the same IP address.
Can have 10.10.10.10 on one subnet and 10.10.20.10 on another subnet.
All 0's in the host portion designates the network (gateway) address and cannot be allocated to a host.
All 1's in the host portion designates the directed broadcast address and cannot be allocated to a host.

Slash (CIDR - Classless Inter-Domain Routing) uses a slash instead of a full subnet mask. /24 = 255.255.255.0
