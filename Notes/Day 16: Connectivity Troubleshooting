Ping uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) uses the TCP/IP stack and is used for two way connectivity checking.
Extended ping is used from a router on the same subnet. The command ping (no IP address specified) will allow the extended ping options.
Traceroute traces the path a packet is taking across a network. Takes advantage of the TTL header, each hop will send a TTL back to the source. CTRL+Shift+6 will end the command.
