Define Problem: Clearly specify what the problem is
Gather Information: Find out information about the problem (ping host if the connection is down, ask if any changed recently, etc)
Analyze Information: Ask relevant questions (show and debug commands, ask people) and analyze the output for clues on how to solve the problem
Eliminate Potential Causes: Process of elimination to narrow down potential cause
Propose Hypothesis: Take all information into account and determine a best guess solution
Test Hypothesis: Implement the hypothesis and observe if the problem is resolved
Solve Problem and Document Solution: Important for future issues

Compare configurations for configuration issues. For connectivity problems, trace the path - start at the source and move toward the destination. Swap out components if hardware is likely the issue. 
ping to check connectivity from source to host, traceroute if there are multiple hops between source and destination, and telnet to get onto the command line of a device or checking if a port is open on a device.
