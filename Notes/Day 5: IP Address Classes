The global coordination of Internet IPv4 addressing is performed by IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority).
The bigger the host portion of the network, the more hosts we can have. If the subnet mask is /8, we have 24 bits to allocate to hosts. If the subnet mask is /24, we only have 8 bits to allocate to hosts. 
Class A, B, and C include all the addresses that are available to be assigned to hosts. Class D and E are reserved.

Class A Addresses:
Class A addresses are assigned to networks with a very large number of hosts. 
The high order (the first bit, 128 in the first octet) in a class A address is always set to zero.
Default subnet mask is /8
Valid address ranges from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0 /8 - allows for 126 networks and 16,777,214 hosts per network
Example Class A address: 2.0.0.10/8
0.0.0.0/8 range is reserved and signifies "this network"
0.0.0.0 to 0.255.255.255 are not valid host addresses
127.0.0.0/8 range is reserved for Loopback Addresses
127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are not valid host addresses
Both "this network" and Loopback Addresses wiped out 33,554,428 possible host addresses from the global address pool

Class B Addresses:
Assigned to medium-sized to large networks
The two high order bits in a class B address are always set to binary 1 0
Default subnet mask is /16
Valid address ranges from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0 /16 - allows for 16,384 networks with 65,534 hosts per network
Example Class B address: 131.192.0.0/16

Class C Addresses:
Used for small networks
The three high order bits in a class C address are always set to binary 1 1 0
Default subnet mask is /24
Valid network address range from 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.0 /24  - allows for 2,097,152 networks and 254 hosts per network
Example Class C address: 195.0.192.0/24
Can be allocated as is for a real world network, or subnetted into smaller subnets

Private Addresses (RFC 1918): 
There is a range of reserved private addresses in each class
These are valid to be assigned to a host, but they are not routable on the public internet
Originally designed for hosts in a closed private network with no internet connectivity
Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255 with a default subnet mask of /8   255.0.0.0
Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255 with a default subnet mask of /12   255.240.0.0
Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255 with a default subnet mask of /16   255.255.0.0

Class D Addresses:
Reserved for IP multicast addresses
The four high order bits in a class D address are always set to binary 1 1 1 1
These addresses are not allocated to hosts, and there is no default subnet mask
Valid addresses range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Example Class D address: 227.1.192.5

Class E Addresses:
Experimental and reserved for future use
The high order bits in a class E address are set to 1 1 1 1
These addresses are not allocated to hosts, and there is no default subnet mask
Addresses range from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
Example Class E address: 243.1.192.10
255.255.255.255 is the broadcast address for "this network"

IP Address Class Summary:
Class	  First Octet	  Slash	   Dotted Decimal
 A		  1 - 126	      /8	     255.0.0.0
 B		  128 - 191	    /16	     255.255.0.0
 C	  	192 - 223	    /24	     255.255.255.0
 D		  224 - 239	     -	      -
 E		  240 - 255	     -	      -
