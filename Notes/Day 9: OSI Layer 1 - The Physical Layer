Layer 1 conveys the bit stream - electrical impulse, light, or radio signals - through the network at the electrical and mechanical level. Provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data, including defining cables, interface cards, and physical aspects. 

Ethernet LAN can be carried over coaxial (not used now), twisted copper pair (UTP or STP), fiber, or wireless. UTP/STP use RJ-45 and have a max transmission length of 100m. Straight through cables are used to connect end points to a switch, crossover cables are used to connect devices directly together directly. Modern switches support Auto MDI-X, where the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured automatically to yield the expected result.

Fiber optic cables support longer distances and higher bandwidth requirements - separate buildings in a campus, switch to switch inside a building, etc. Single mode supports higher bandwidth and longer distances, but is more expensive. Multimode is cheaper but covers less distance and is lower bandwidth.
