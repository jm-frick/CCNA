The Transfer Layer provides transparent transfer of data between hosts and is responsible for end-to-end error recovery and flow control. 
Flow Control is the p[rocess of adjusting the flow of data from the sender to ensure that the receiving host can handle it.
Session Multiplexing is the process by which a host is able to support multiple sessions simultaneously and manage the individual traffic streams over a single link.
Port numbers are used to identify the upper layer protocol. The sender also adds a source port number to the layer 4 header. The combination of source and destination port numbers can be used to track sessions. 
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are the most common layer 4 protocols. 

TCP is:
Connection oriented: once a connection is established, data can be sent bidirectionally over that connection.
Carries out sequencing to ensure segments are processed in the correct order and none are missing.
Is reliable; the receiving host sends acknowledgments back to the sender. Lost segments are resent.
Performs flow control.
FTP (21), SSH (22), Telnet (23), HTTP (80), HTTPS (443)
BOTH: DNS (53)

UDP:
Sends traffic as best effort.
Not connection oriented. No handshake setup between hosts.  
Does not carry out sequencing to ensure segments are processed in the correct order and none are missing.
Not reliable; the receiving host does not send acknowledgments back to the sender.
Does not perform flow control.
If error detection and recovery is required, it is up to the upper layers to provide it. 
TFTP (69), SNMP (161)
BOTH: DNS (53)

Application developers will typically choose to use TCP for traffic which requires reliability. Real time applications such as voice and video can't afford the extra overhead of TCP so they use UDP. Some applications can use both.
