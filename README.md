# CCNA
This is a repository of all the resources used to study for the CCNA exam. A combination of Neil Anderson's course, Jeremy's IT lab, Wendell Odom's OCG, and Boson ExSim was used to compile the notes here.

I passed the exam with the following scores: 

Automation and Programmability: 90%

Network Access: 95%

IP Connectivity: 88%

IP Services: 90%

Security Fundamentals: 93%

Network Fundamentals: 90%


I hope to help someone else on their journey to pass the exam.
